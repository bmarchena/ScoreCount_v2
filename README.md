# ScoreCount_ImplicitIntent


Two team score counter using two activities and both explicit and implicit intents.

In this application, the user uses two buttons to increment the scores of two teams starting from 0. Once a team reaches a score of 5, the "game" ends and that team is determined to be the winner. A second activity is started which declares the winner and also calculates and outputs the score spread of the game. A button on the second activity starts a third activity where the user can share their victory to a friend by inputting a phone number. This activity contains 3 buttons: the first places a call to the inputted phone number, the second sends a message declaring the winner and score spread to the phone number, the third searches for basketball in the user's area.
